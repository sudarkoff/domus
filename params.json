{"name":"Domus","body":"Domus is a cross-platform, high-performance, extensible home automation system written in C++. It listens to events, evaluates conditions and fires actions in response. In other words, it's a rules engine of sorts. Because it's using a plugins-based architecture, it can be integrated into various systems (e.g.: X10, ZigBee, Z-Wave and so on).\r\n\r\nIn addition to responding to events, Domus will be attempting to discern stable patterns that could be used to predict and fire actions proactively (and ultimately take over the human race).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease contact George Sudarkoff (@bitcomber) if you have questions or would like to contribute to the project.\r\n","tagline":"Domus - Open-Source Home Automation System","google":"UA-30841630-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
